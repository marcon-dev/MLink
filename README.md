MLink is an open-source bookmark and link manager that brings back the essence of the early, open web. It‚Äôs a return to simple, functional services that work directly in your browser without requiring registration, accounts, or payments.

This tool was created to solve the daily problem of disorganized links and the fear of forgetting. In a world of information overload, it's easy to lose track of interesting articles, tools, and pages. While many bookmarking alternatives exist, they often come with advanced features that can be resource-intensive, require you to trust your data with third-party servers, and lock you into an ecosystem.

MLink shines in its simplicity and minimalism, ensuring that even older computers and simpler browsers can run it smoothly. It's a fast, private, and efficient way to manage your links without compromising your data.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Single-Input Interface:** Add links with a name, tag, and description using a flexible, comma-separated format (`Name, Tag, URL, Description`).
- **Intelligent Name Extraction:** If you only provide a URL, MLink will automatically generate a clean name for your bookmark.
- **100% Private:** All your data is stored locally in your browser's `localStorage`. No accounts, no cloud, no tracking.
